# Calculator-project

Welcome to my first Python calculator project!   
This is a simple command-line calculator I built to practice the basics of Python programming.

# What it does
It's a basic calculator that lets you:
- Add, subtract, multiply, or divide two numbers
- Keep using it in a loop until you decide to exit
- Handle invalid inputs gracefully (like dividing by zero)

# How to use it
1. Run the script (`Calculator.py`) in your terminal or IDE.
2. Enter two numbers when asked.
3. Choose your operation (+, -, *, /).
4. Press Enter to continue or type anything else to exit.

Simple, clean, and beginner-friendly.

# Why I built this
I wanted to get comfortable with:
- Python input/output
- Writing functions
- Basic loops and conditionals
- Making small but functional programs

# What's next
In future versions, Iâ€™d love to:
- Add more operations (like modulus, power, square root)
- Build a GUI version using Tkinter
- Organize the logic using classes

Thanks for checking it out!
